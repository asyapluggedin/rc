### What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?

> I've been pretty fascinated with Plan 9! 
> 
> I was researching various clocks, for a time zone converting web app project I decided to make for polishing up my rusty javascript. On Are.na, I found some images of the Kit-Kat clock, and thought it would be a cute addition to my website, to have it in the background, syncing with the output time. I spent some time drawing my own Kit-Kat .svg and then felt compelled to look up if anyone had already made a digital cat clock, and found out that an actual Kit-Kat clock program was part of the Plan 9 operating system way back in '92! 
> 
> The screenshots of the OS absolutely charmed me, and I spent several nights figuring out how to get Plan 9 to run on one of my old laptops. This all turned into a whole rabbit hole of learning more about Bell Labs, the history of UNIX, Rob Pike's work with Go, and Reneé French's art. 
> 
> I had a lot of fun learning about "vintage" operating systems, and spent an evening with my partner taking turns answering absurd prompts like "what kind of operating system would you design for a spider". (If you were wondering, a web-based one.)

### What do you want to be doing in two years?

> I would like to find myself working in a team of kind, engineering-industry-experienced people who I feel comfortable both learning from and sharing my knowledge with.
> 
> I want to work on beautiful and necessary digital infrastructure that makes the world a more just place.
> 
> Also, I'd like to find myself regularly contributing to open source projects, and making that the focus of my social media presence, rather than it being just a handful of personal accounts.

### Why do you want to attend RC? How would attending RC be different than working on your own?

> I'm most excited about the RC community. 
> While I could work on my own, join a self-learning discord community, or attend a bootcamp (and I have done variations of all three), I notice that knowledge & skills aren't very "sticky" unless I am continuously surrounded by people who are focused on learning. I feel very much aligned with RC's "never graduate" motto.
> 
> I also agree with the self-directed approach.
> As a person with ADHD, I have spent a lot of time thinking about productivity & learning "hacks", as well as motivations for learning. The approaches at RC are consistent with what works for me – pair programming, spontaneously changing course, showing up every day to work at the "edge of my abilities".
> I've spent a lot of time attending traditional academic institutions, and some time teaching children programming – both experiences have radicalized me towards "unschooling".<sup>see edit below</sup>

```markdown
EDIT FROM 2024: I have educated myself more on the topic of unschooling and do not support it any longer. I am keeping my application up as I originally wrote and sent it to RC.
```
> 
> Finally, there's the career bit. 
> I work as a designer, and miss media art school, particularly when I got to program – so I'd really like to get back into the swing of creative coding, and move towards calling myself a "design engineer", rather than an interface designer. I'd also be delighted to work alongside RC alumni, either already existing ones, or the ones you haven't even met yet :)



### What would you like to work on at RC?

Deep dive into JavaScript
> - Finish Eloquent JavaScript book
> - Make a browser game that trains you to guess color values in RGB, HSB, etc
> - Make my savefrys.com project look non-embarrassing
> - Finish my cat clock time zone converting website
> - TypeScript project
> - PureScript project

Functional programming
> - Build confidence with Haskell to the point where I can comfortably [generate art with it](https://paytonturnage.com/writing/generating-art-with-haskell/)

Swift
> - Start to ship code for a type racing game I designed in 2020.
> - I can start with a simpler iOS app, for ex. an interface on top of a Shortcuts automation.
> - Go through [100 days of swift ui](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

Misc
> - Get a lot better at command line
> - Get a lot better at python
> - Discord.py

Contributions
> - Give a mini-talk or workshop on creative coding
> - Blog every day
> - Contribute to p5.js


Things I'm interested in that I won't have the time to focus on at RC:

> - vintage operating systems, playing with them, hacking around in them
> - creative tools, making them, contributing to the open source ones
> - learn about image compression
> - hardware controllers
> - electrical engineering
> - teach myself how to make a radio
> - publish a diy smarthome handbook
> - imagine my own js library
> - make art in conways game of life
> - learn blender
> - build basic things in Rust, Go, Solidity
> - Figure out how Vercel works


## Background
### Describe your programming background in a few sentences.

> I'm a designer whose primary experience with programming is in front-end web development and creative coding with Processing and Python.

> Both my education and work have demanded more focus on visual design, so my programming skills have gotten rather rusty.

### Have you worked professionally as a programmer?

> I have not – only as a designer, or a wordpress css tweaker.
> 
> One time, years ago, I was paid $500 to put together neural network for generating text. I spent a week scouring the web for tutorials and similar projects, and put together a pretty reasonable program, which my client did not like, as it was only accessible from the command line!

### Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?

> I have a degree from the Design | Media Arts program at UCLA, where I took several courses on Processing, one on HTML+CSS+JS, and one on AI art where we used python in Google Colab, although heavily relying on tutorials and frameworks. 
> I also audited an intro to C++ class, as well as a data analysis class that used R.
> 
> I have thought about studying CS at the graduate level for career-related purposes, and Electrical Engineering for personal curiosity. 
> 
> I've also considered attending coding bootcamps:
> - to augment my design-heavy resume
> - to get certain programming syntax and basics to stick in my brain
> - to work on some programming portfolio projects with collaborators

### What other commitments (work, life, family) would you have during your batch?

> Work: n/a, I am able to spend 100% of my time on RC.
> 
> Life / Family: I'll likely spend a week in Mexico City around June 22 to celebrate my partner's birthday. 

### How did you first hear about RC?
> I posted on Instagram Stories about getting accepted to Grace Hopper Academy, to which I applied on a whim*. Two of my friends reached out to suggest I instead attend RC: Solomon Bothwell and Dmitry Mazin. They are both RC alumni. 
> 
> *
> *This whim was inspired by coming back to the US from Russia, where I realized I could not work, study, or just hang out in with good conscience any longer, given the invasion in Ukraine. I've always wanted to become "more of a programmer", and decided that there is no time like the present to pursue this. Bonus points if extending my skillset translates to a boost in income, which would mean more opportunities to financially support people affected by the war.*
> 
### How long ago did you first hear about RC?

> Shockingly, I first heard about RC just this month, April 2022!
> 
### What convinced you to apply today?

> When I first visited the RC website, I could immediately tell "oh, this has the right vibe". 
> 
> I then had a 1.5 hour long phone call with Solomon to talk about the goals I'm pursuing by looking at coding bootcamps, as well as his experience at RC, and realized that I'd be a lot happier and potentially more productive (at least breadth-wise) after an RC batch, rather than after a bootcamp (that would also cost double the student debt I have from UCLA!). 
> 
> I opened up the application page, felt a little hesitant about the years-old program I knew I could submit, and then though "eh, if I'm rejected, I'll just try again later."
> 
> I know for sure that I'd like to attend RC at some point in this lifetime. As it turns out, I have the time for a batch this summer!
