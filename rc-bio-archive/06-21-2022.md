## What I did before RC

Interface design & usability at Are.na, Muze, Mindpet, as well as UCode where I taught children the basics of front-end programming.


I studied at [dma.ucla.edu](https://dma.ucla.edu/) , where I got the chance to play with: 
mixed reality (XR) performance, MoCap, VR, 3D modeling, 3D printing, CNC fabrication, plywood, hardwood, data visualization, Arduino, 1996 style web development, RPGs, ML art, python, Jupyter, Processing, p5.js, etc

## What I'd like to learn and work on at RC

Creative tools + health tech. Another way to put it is “computational augmentation of the human mind – body system”. I'm using my time at RC to become more of a "design engineer", since at work I focus mostly on interface visuals.

1. first, i will put a blog on [my website](https://asyaplugged.in/) (markdown with a telegram channel integration for comments)
2. then i'll go down the list of things I put down in my [rc application](https://github.com/asyapluggedin/rc/blob/master/application/application-2022.md) or more likely, make a new list lol
